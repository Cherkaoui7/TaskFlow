🔎 TaskFlow – Issues & UX Audit Report
1️⃣ Functional / Logic Problems
1. Dashboard Metrics Inconsistency

“Projets actifs: 4”

“Mes tâches: 0”

“Tâches en retard: 0”

“À venir cette semaine: 0”

Problem:
All projects show “0 tâches”.
This makes the dashboard partially meaningless since:

A collaborative task manager without tasks is not realistic.

The dashboard KPIs are not validated against actual project data.

Potential Issue:

Tasks are not properly linked to projects.

Aggregation logic for statistics may be incorrect or incomplete.

User-task assignment logic may not be implemented.

2. Mes Tâches Page – Empty State Problem

Message:

“Aucune tâche assignée.”

Problem:
No call-to-action is provided.

UX Gap:

No button like:

“Voir tous les projets”

“Créer une tâche”

“Demander une assignation”

This creates a dead-end screen.

3. Projects Page – Blue Dot Indicator

Each project card shows a blue dot (top-right).

Problem:
There is no legend explaining what the blue dot means.

UX Issue:
Users cannot interpret:

Is it active?

Has unread updates?

Is it selected?

This is ambiguous UI signaling.

4. Profile Page – Weak Information Hierarchy

Issues:

Avatar is static (just initial “C”).

No ability to upload/change photo.

Email displayed twice (header + detail).

No security settings (password, 2FA, etc.)

UX Impact:
Profile page feels incomplete and not production-ready.

2️⃣ UI Consistency Issues
1. Language Mixing

UI is French:

Dashboard

Mes tâches

Profil

Déconnexion

But:

Project names: “frontend”, “backend”, “full stack”

Descriptions partially French

Issue:
Language consistency is not enforced.

You must:

Either use full French UI

Or allow language switching (i18n)

2. Button Hierarchy Problem

Examples:

“Déconnexion” button is very visually dominant (red, strong).

“Nouveau projet” is secondary blue.

UX principle violation:
Destructive action (logout) should not dominate over primary workflow action (create project).

3. Spacing & Layout Density

Projects grid:

Uneven whitespace.

Last row has only one card → breaks symmetry.

No responsive breakpoint adaptation shown.

Could cause:

Poor mobile experience.

Visual imbalance.

3️⃣ UX & Product Design Issues
1. No Activity Feedback

There is:

No recent activity

No notifications

No collaboration indicators

No task progress bars

For a collaborative tool, this reduces engagement.

2. No Project Progress Visualization

Each project card only shows:

Title

Description

“0 tâches”

“Actif”

Missing:

Progress %

Completed vs Pending

Deadline

Assigned members

Last updated

This makes project cards low-information density.

3. Missing Navigation Context

Navigation has:

Dashboard

Projets

Mes tâches

Profil

But:

No active state highlight shown.

No breadcrumbs.

No visual indicator of current page (weak UX clarity).

4. Search UX is Underpowered

Search bar:

“Rechercher un projet…”

Problems:

No filter by status.

No sorting.

No debounce UX.

No empty-state message if no results.

4️⃣ Architecture-Level Observations (Important)

This looks like:

UI-first implementation

Minimal domain modeling

Missing enterprise-grade features:

Role-based access (admin/member)

Project membership management

Task ownership logic

Real-time updates

Notifications

If this is your MERN project, you need:

Proper schema relationships:

User → Projects (many-to-many)

Project → Tasks (one-to-many)

Task → Assigned User (many-to-one)

Aggregation pipelines for dashboard KPIs.

🧠 Strategic UX Improvements
Priority Fixes

Add proper task creation & assignment flow.

Add meaningful empty states with CTA.

Add progress indicators on project cards.

Clarify visual indicators (blue dot).

Improve dashboard analytics.

Mid-Level Improvements

Add filtering & sorting.

Add language consistency.

Improve active navigation highlight.

Advanced Improvements

Real-time collaboration (Socket.io).

Notifications.

Role-based permissions.

Project analytics panel.

🎯 Final Evaluation

Current state:
✅ Clean UI
✅ Good spacing & modern design
❌ Weak product logic
❌ Incomplete user flows
❌ Low information density
❌ No engagement mechanics

It looks like a frontend MVP, not yet a production-ready collaborative system.
